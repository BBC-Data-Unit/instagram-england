In December 2015 Daniel Wainwright and Paul Bradshaw [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35167631) on the most popular locations outside London photographed and shared by Instagram users.

We asked Instagram for the data, which was released for the first time. Instagram does not release figures for the number of times each location was photographed. However, a spokeswoman revealed its users were "twice as likely to Instagram Brighton Pier compared to the University of Oxford", which is the seventh most popular site.
